# How to join Microsoft OSS GitHub org

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

> This applies to Microsoft FTEs only

## Overview

- Very rough draft

Link your GitHub account to Microsoft OSS <https://docs.opensource.microsoft.com/github/accounts/linking/>

Microsoft OSS Portal <https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/>
- Click on the `Organizations` tab
- Join the `Microsoft` organization
  - Click on the `Join button`
    - You may get a second screen and have to click `Join` again
- Repeat for the `CSE-Labs` organization
- Repeat for any other organizations you want to join

You should get emails for the new organization(s) you joined. The GitHub bot should automatically add you to the orgs. To verify:

  - Go to your GitHub home page <https://github.com/yourGitHubName>
  - Accept any invitations from the organizations (there may not be any)
 
- Verify access to CSE-Labs <https://github.com/cse-labs/private-test>
  - If you get a 404, make sure you joined the `CSE-Labs` organization correctly
